# Forecasting-Outcomes-of-NCAA-Women-Basketball-Games

Nowadays, it is popular to predict the result of sports competitions. In this project, we are going to predict the
results of the 2019 NCAA Division I Women’s Basketball Championship. Specifically speaking, we are going to explore
different approaches that can predict the probabilities for possible matchups.

NCAA women’s basketball tournament is an annual college basketball tournament held each March and can be separated into
regional tournaments. There are many basketball games played between Division I women’s teams for each season while
culminated into the national championship between 64 teams.

Provided with a large amount of historical data, our investigations on this project consists of 5 main parts. At first,
we calculate RPI and then examine a logistic regression using difference between RPI. We also explore feature reduction
with decision tree and random forest. In addition, we divide the problem into two questions. One is to predict the winning
probability of a particular team, given two teams playing against each other in a tournament. The other is to predict the
expected number of wins a team will have in the tournament. We answer these two questions by going through the process of
regression modeling, predicting and cross-validation. In the further investigation, we use a neural network to classify
whether a team's point differential in its won games have an effect on its future probability to win games.
